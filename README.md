## The goal 
This project builds a recommender for stock market prices given a specific stock of chosen.

## Overview
Machine Learning (ML) especially Deep Learning  (DL) has been a powerful tool in dealing with statistical data with patterns and trends, in particular if the data are substantial. It would be foolish to claim that any tool or person can predict the future of the stock market accurately, as it is intrinsically probabilistic. But one can at least give good recommendations based on historical data, if there are inherent dominant deciding factors that can be learned from, even these factors are correlated and complex that cannot be expressed in a single mathematical formalism. The premise of this project is machine learning techniques can be used to inform better investment decisions, thus oneâ€™s trades/investments are based on data not random guesses.  

## Model statement
There are so many things one can do with stock market data, since the data themselves can be huge and diverse. We want to delimit our data to daily prices (e.g. close price of that day) and try to predict short- (e.g days) and long-term (e.g. months) price changes for specific stocks. As the main goal of the model, we will try to focus ourselves in tech sectors (e.g. Microsoft, Google, etc), since more similarities can be found for the stocks from the same sector at given periods of time.

My goal in this project is to develop a recommender that predicts the future stock prices for chosen companies based on their historical data, using DL Neural Networks (NN), specifically Recurrent NN (which has been heavily used in natural language processing ) and provide advice on investing and trading. 

## Stage
Right now the model has been built, trained and tested (details shown in the report). Model refinement and deployment (using AWS or Google Cloud) 
will be next steps.
